# TELNET BINARY PACK WITH JANSI

(c)2019 Oduvaldo Pavan Junior - ducasp@gmail.com

This pack includes MEMMAN and JANSI as well as TELNET.

As far as I know those are free and it is ok to distribute.

If you have a MSX2/2+ with KANJI rom, you can use JANSI by
calling ANSI.BAT before executing TELNET.

P.s.: MEMMAN loads in BASIC, and by going to BASIC and then
returning to DOS, all your environment variables like PATH
will be lost... :)
