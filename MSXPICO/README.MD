# MSX Pico

MSX Pico is a cartridge / interface developed by Jeroen Taverne and its project
page can be found at:

https://github.com/jeroentaverne/msxpico

It adds several features to the MSX, and Jeroen is working on having the same
ESP8266 Wi-Fi solution I've implemented for SM-X / OCM on it. In this page you
will find my contribution to the BIOS as well utilities related to the Wi-Fi
solution. The ESP8266 custom firmware used is exactly the same as used in SM-X
or OCM and its source code can be found at:

All source code and binaries:

All code can be re-used, re-written, derivative work can be sold, as long as the
source code of changes is made public as well.
