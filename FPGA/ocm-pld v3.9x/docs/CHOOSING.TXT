NOTE: NEVER, EVER THINK ABOUT USING MC2P IF YOU DON'T HAVE MC2P, SM-X IF YOUR
DEVICE IS OTHER THAN SM-X, ETC... Cheat Sheet is only to help you choose what
version for your device has the features you want. If your device doesn't have
a feature or the combination of features you want, DO NOT USE THE FIRMWARE OF
OTHER DEVICE, IT WILL BRICK YOUR DEVICE AND YOU WILL ONLY BE ABLE TO RECOVER IT
USING USB BLASTER AND A PC. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!

IMPORTANT! READ THIS AND BE CAREFUL! BRICKING YOUR 2nd GEN FPGA MSX ISN'T FUN!
IT IS A PAIN TO RESTORE IT USING JIC / USB BLASTER AS YOU WILL NEED TO CONNECT
IT TO AN USB BLASTER TO RESTORE IT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! REALLY!

ONLY USE SMXFLASH.COM to update your 2nd Gen FPGA MSX (SM-X, SMX-HB, SM-X Mini,
SX2). DO NOT USE SMXFLASH IN A MULTICORE 2+, AS FOR IT THE CORE IS A MCP FILE
AND YOU JUST NEED TO SUBSTITUTE THE OLD MCP FILE. ONLY USE A FIRMWARE THAT IS
MEANT TO YOUR DEVICE. EACH DEVICE USE A DIFFERENT SET OF CONNECTIONS, SOME USE
DIFFERENT FPGAs, SO DO NOT EVER THINK OF USING A 1ST GEN PLD FILE OR A 2ND GEN
PLD FILE THAT DOESN'T CARRY YOUR DEVICE NAME IN THE PACKAGE.

The version of SMXFLASH.COM that is sent along with the firmware files also
works on NEXTOR. Older versions of SMXFLASH.COM requires MSX DOS 2 Kernel to be
loaded. Why would you use other version? I have no idea. Read this fully and
be carefull to not have any issues. Command line to update (again, except for
MC2+ where you just replace the .MCP file for the new one):

SMXFLASH OCM_SM.PLD

Wait until it quits to the dos prompt telling it is done. If there is an error
message after it started erasing or writing, try again until it works, as if
you power it down with an unfinished update, it will BRICK and you will need
to use an USB Blaster and JIC file to restore it, like said above, a pain!

Also, be aware that if power fails during update, you are most likely to end up
with a bricked unit and you will need to use an USB Blaster and JIC file to
restore it, again, a pain!

How to choose the firmware? (except for MC2+ that has a single firmware)

1 - Obviously, you will download the one for your device. (i.e.: I have a SM-X,
so I get firmware files from folders that start with smx_)

2 - Next step is to look at the version table to choose the version that has
what you want to use, or the closest to it. In some devices you will need to
not have some features in order to have other, so choose according to that. Do
not worry, if later you wanna a feature that the version chosen doesn't have it
, you can always update the firmware again with a version that has the feature.

3 - WOW! That folder contains 20 different firmware files!!! I have no idea how
to choose from...

    - Do not worry, first, let's get down to four different files, you do this
    by figuring out your PS/2 Keyboard Layout, French, Spanish, Brazilian,
    Italian or US. IMPORTANT: SD-BIOS DO NOT CHANGE Keyboard Layout, so it is
    important to choose the correct one :)
    - Now, you have four different versions, let's get down to two. Do you
    prefer backslash symbol to be shown as a real backslash or do you prefer a
    it to be shown as the yen symbol like japanese MSX's? Based on that, choose
    yen or backslash. If you use SD-BIOS, then this is not relevant as the
    SD-BIOS will override whatever is flashed in that regards
    - Finally, you will have SINGLE EPBIOS or DUAL EPBIOS. On DUAL EPBIOS, if
    you do not use a SD-BIOS, you can easily switch between Nextor or MSX Dos 2
    kernel by flicking dip-switch 7. In the position for 4096 MB Mapper it will
    use Nextor Kernel (this change needs turning the device off and then on to
    take effect), in the position for 2048 MB Mapper it will use MSX Dos 2
    Kernel. Single EPBIOS use only MSX Dos 2 Kernel. If you use SD-BIOS, then
    this is not relevant as the SD-BIOS will override whatever is flashed in
    that regards. If you use an external interface with Nextor, you might need
    to use MSX Dos 2 Kernel (by either having Single EPBIOS or setting Mapper
    size to 2048MB / Choosing MSX Dos 2 Kernel if having Dual EPBIOS) as there
    is a bug in some Nextor Kernel version that doesn't allow devices with a 
    different Nextor Kernel version in it. OCM Nextor Kernel already has the
    fix for this, so it might not be necessary using MSX Dos 2 Kernel to use it
    with different interfaces.

4 - Now you have your firmware file, just use it :)
