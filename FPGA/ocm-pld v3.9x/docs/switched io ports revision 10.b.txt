This is an add-on to switched io ports revision 10.pdf, only adding information
not covered by it.

Keyboard shortcuts / Modules activated by Keyboard:

HRA! Auto Fire module w/ 16 levels of speed:
    - To toggle its state from disabled/enabled, CTRL + SHIFT + PG UP | PG DOWN
      (either one will just toggle the current state)
    - To decrease the auto-fire rate (or a nice shortcut to the maximum speed
      after enabling it, since it starts at the slowest speed), CTRL + PG DOWN
    - To increase the auto-fire rate, CTRL + PG UP

SM-X HB Hotbit Keyboard shortcuts:
    - PG UP can be simulated by SELECT and +
    - PG DOWN can be simulated by SELECT and -
    - F9 to F12 can be simulated by SELECT and F1 to F4

New Smart Commands:
    - 89: turn off SMX-HB joystick port debounce (non joystick devices might
          not play nice with debounce on depending on how fast they transition
          states). Doesn't affect SM-X/SM-X Mini/SX2.
    - 8A: turn on SMX-HB joystick port debounce (default). Doesn't affect SM-X
          /SM-X Mini/SX2.
    - 8B: regular function of I/O 48 and 49 when switched I/O is selected
          (default).
    - 8C: I/O ports 48 and 49 are redirect to SN76489 / Emulated Franky PSG non
          matter if switched I/O is selected or not (only for builds that have
          SN76489).
    - 8D: Joystick port 1 assigned to real Joystick port 1 (default)
    - 8E: Turn on VAUS Paddle Emulation, using a PS/2 Mouse as reference for a
          paddle emulation. Real Joystick port 1 is disabled, mouse buttons 1
          and 2 work as the only VAUS Paddle button and mouse button 3 will
          cycle through four different levels of sensitivity. This will persist
          after boots, reset only with 8D or power cycle / cold boot.
    - 8F: Turn on MSX Standard Paddle Emulation, using a PS/2 Mouse as
          reference for a paddle emulation. Real Joystick port 1 is disabled,
          mouse buttons 1 and 2 work as Buttons A and B of the MSX Paddle and
          mouse button 3 will cycle through four different levels of
          sensitivity. IMPORTANT: MSX Standard Paddles are generally read using
          BIOS routines, and those BIOS routines are hard coded to work
          properly with Z80 clock at ~3.58MHz. Using Turbo CPU speeds might
          cause it to be much more sensible to movements and the movement to
          not be smooth, exactly as would happen to a real MSX Standard Paddle.
          This will persist after boots, reset only with 8D or power cycle /
          cold boot.
