# FPGA

MSX-SM is a MSX system implemented in FPGA. It has been cloned (which is
absolutely fine as it is an open project) as SX2, and has, as of the date of
this readme, two variants, SM-X Mini and SMX-HB (SMX-HB Mini is just a version
of SMX-HB that doesn't need a Hotbit case).

It is derived from OCM/Zemmix Neo adding extra features (newer FPGA that has 
more room, HDMI output, WiFi communications, etc). Its project is developed
by Victor Trucco and the FPGA code started from KdL OCM/Zemmix FPGA 
implementation with additions made by Victor Trucco and other developers like
myself and KdL incorporated many of those into his official builds.

In this repository you will find source code of builds based on KdL OCM
firmware.

All source code from OCM 3.9.1 originally is a work of many people, including
KdL and Hara-san that are really huge contributors to it!

All code can be re-used, re-written, derivative work can be sold, as long as the
source code of changes is made public as well.
