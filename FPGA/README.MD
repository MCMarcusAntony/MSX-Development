MSX-SM is a MSX system implemented in FPGA. It has been cloned (which is
absolutely fine as it is an open project) as SX2, and has, as of the date of
this readme, two variants, SM-X Mini and SMX-HB.

It is derived from OCM/Zemmix Neo adding extra features (newer FPGA that has 
more room, HDMI output, WiFi communications, etc). It's project is developed
by Victor Trucco and the FPGA code started from KdL OCM/Zemmix FPGA 
implementation with additions made by Victor Trucco and other developers like
myself and KdL incorporated many of those into his official builds.

In this repository you will find source code of builds based on KdL OCM
firmware.

All code can be re-used, re-written, derivative work can be sold, as long as the
source code of changes is made public as well.
