# ANSI-DRV

ANSI-DRV is an amazing piece of software by Tobias Keizer!

It is a very, very, very fast ANSI COLOR Text Rendering engine for MSX2 and beyond.

But, it had a few shortcomings for what I would like to use, so I've asked Toby if it would be ok to change it, and he was
really kind sending me the source code.

Also, he was really kind by allowing me to share the source code on my GitHub!

All source code and binaries: 
(c)Tobias Keizer (original version)
(c)2019 Oduvaldo Pavan Junior - ducasp@gmail.com (modified version, remember, all hard work was done by Toby!)

All code can be re-used, re-written, as long as the source code of changes is made public as well.
