# MSX-SM

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/R6R2BRGX6)

MSX-SM is a MSX system implemented in FPGA.

It is derived from OCM/Zemmix Neo adding extra features (newer FPGA that has 
more room, HDMI output, WiFi communications, etc). It's hardware is developed
by Victor Trucco and the FPGA code started from KDL OCM/Zemmix FPGA 
implementation with additions made by Victor Trucco and other developers. 
The MSX-SM FPGA code can be found at:

In this repository you will find source code of software I've made that rely
on MSX-SM specific features and won't work on other MSX systems (although it
could be adapted).

All code can be re-used, re-written, derivative work can be sold, as long as the
source code of changes is made public as well.
