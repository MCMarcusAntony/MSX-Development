Simple Terminal for MSX-SM
Copyright (c) 2019 Oduvaldo Pavan Junior ( ducasp@ gmail.com )
All rights reserved.

A simple terminal console where what you type is sent to the ESP and what
the ESP send back is put on screen. Useful to toy around with it and see
how it works with AT commands or testing concepts. 

Requires WiFiMSXSM, SDCC and Fusion-C library to compile
